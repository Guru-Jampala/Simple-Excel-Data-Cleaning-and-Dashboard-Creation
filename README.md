**Bike Sales Dashboard** 

Excel Project Dataset from Alex the Analyst Youtube Channel

# **1. Data Cleaning**

  - Made a new sheet called "Working Sheet" so I can always come back to the original raw data 

    (Just like creating a BACKUP Database on SQL)
<br>

  - Checked and removed duplicates
<br><br>
  - Find and replace some confusing data to make it clearer
<br><br>

  - Created a new column called the 'Age Brackets' column (for easier visualization and to categorize the ages)
<br>
  - Created **Nested IF Statements** on the 'Age Brackets' column
